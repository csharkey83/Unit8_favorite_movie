                <td> The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan, takes place at the end of the 19th Century, in London. Two magicians, Robert Angier (placed by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale)are partners and good friends until their assistant, Julia McCullough (played by Piper Perabo), the wife of Robert, accidentally dies during one of their acts, for which Robert blames Alfred for forcing their friendship and partnership to turn into a bitter rivalry. The now enemy magicians both become famous, spending their entire career and life sabotaging each other's performances and trying to one-up eachother. This Rivalry and obsession to out-do one another takes them on a race to being the first to perform the best and ultimate disappearing act, "The Transported Man", which they will do anything to accomplish. </td>
